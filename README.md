ðŸ§  Sentiment Analysis of Book Reviews

This module extracts and quantifies the emotional tone of user-generated book reviews to enhance personalization in a hybrid recommendation system. Leveraging transformer-based models (e.g., DistilBERT or BiLSTM with GloVe embeddings), the system classifies reviews into sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral) and generates sentiment scores. These scores are integrated into collaborative and content-based filtering pipelines to better capture user preferences, improve recommendation accuracy, and mitigate cold-start issues.
